This is my humble hass.io configuration repository. It is and will forever be a work in progress.  
My main goal is to automate as much as posible to a near perfect level of efficiency.

This readme will be gradually updated.

## Implemented automations

* Lights
  * On/Off based on movement and sun elevation
  * Stay on in room with last movement
  * Adjust brightness and temperature based on [Circadian rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm)
  * Hallway lights on when door is open and sun elevation below threshold
  * While sleeping do not turn on bedroom lights, other lights use lowest brightness
  * All lights out as soon as no longer at home
  * Schedule on/off of aquarium light
* Alarm
  * Arm when not at home
  * Disarm when at home
  * Arm when asleep
  * Notification when alarm is triggered
* Climate
  * Set heat/off based on presence and inside temperature
* Air purifier
  * Turn on/off LED based on sleep state
  * Set speed based on sleep state an frontend slider settings
* Surveillance
